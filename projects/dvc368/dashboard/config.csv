GDP was 2.3% higher in July to September 2016 compared with the same quarter a year ago.</p><p> This is the first release of GDP covering a full quarter of data following the EU referendum.

,"<p>While there was little change in the CPI, the input and output prices (PPI) for UK manufacturers rose in the year to July 2016. This follows 2 years of falls, although both input and output prices have been following an upward trend since August 2015. Total input prices rose 4.3% in the year to July 2016, compared with a fall of 0.5% in the year to June 2016. Similarly, output prices for goods produced by UK manufacturers rose 0.3% in the year to July 2016, compared with a fall of 0.2% in the year to June 2016.</p>

<p>This suggests that higher input costs are feeding into output prices of manufactured goods. The changes in input and output producer price inflation can be partly attributed to changing oil and petroleum prices, as the cost of crude oil, energy and refined petroleum products has continued to influence the price of manufactured goods. Alongside this, the sharp depreciation in sterling immediately after the EU referendum result may also have had an impact on input producer prices.</p><p>For further information on the effects of post-referendum sterling depreciation on PPI and CPI, please see <a href=""https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/additionalanalysisoftheproducerpriceindexppiandconsumerpriceindexcpi/focusontheeffectsofchangesinthesterlingexchangerate"">Additional analysis of the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a>, which was released alongside the August prices releases.</p>",picton,#206095,Consumer prices,consum,line,https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/d7g7/mm23/data,months,"2008, 01, 01","<p class=""blurb"">The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 0.9% in the year to October 2016, compared with a 1.0% rise in the year to September.
