"Figure 6: EU work-related long-term immigration trends by data source, UK, year ending December 2008 to year ending December 2018",,,,,
Units: thousands,,,,,
"Source: Office for National Statistics – International Passenger Survey, Department for Work and Pensions – National Insurance number registrations to adult overseas nationals",,,,,
Notes:,,,,,
1.     NINo registrations are for all National Insurance number registrations regardless of length of stay or date of arrival so will include short-term migrants and people who may have been in the country a while before registering.,,,,,
2.     There was a change to the process of recording NINos during Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2014 which meant that the volume of NINo registrations recorded were lower in that quarter and then higher in Quarter 3 (July to Sep) 2014 than would otherwise be the case. Comparisons of NINo registrations over time between these periods should be viewed with caution.,,,,,
