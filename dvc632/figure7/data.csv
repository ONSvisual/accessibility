"Figure 7: Non-EU work-related long-term immigration trends by data source, UK, year ending December 2008 to year ending December 2018",,,,,,
Units: thousands,,,,,,
"Source: Office for National Statistics – International Passenger Survey, Home Office – long-term work visas, Department for Work and Pensions – National Insurance number registrations to adult overseas nationals",,,,,,
Notes:,,,,,,
1.     NINo registrations are for all National Insurance number registrations regardless of length of stay or date of arrival so will include short-term migrants and people who may have been in the country a while before registering.,,,,,,
2.     There was a change to the process of recording NINos during Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2014 which meant that the volume of NINo registrations recorded were lower in that quarter and then higher in Quarter 3 (July to Sep) 2014 than would otherwise be the case. Comparisons of NINo registrations over time between these periods should be viewed with caution.,,,,,,
3.     Visa data are Home Office entry clearance visas granted for 12 months or more for main applicants only.,,,,,,
